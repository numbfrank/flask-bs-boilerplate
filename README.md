- **app.py:** The main Flask application file that defines routes and initializes the server.
- **requirements.txt:** Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.
- **Dockerfile:** Docker configuration file for containerizing the application.
- **.dockerignore:** Specifies files and directories to exclude from the Docker build context.
- **templates/:** Contains HTML templates using Jinja2 templating engine.
  - **layout.html:** Base template that includes Bootstrap and defines the overall layout.
  - **index.html:** Home page template that extends `layout.html`.
- **static/:** Contains static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
  - **css/styles.css:** Custom CSS for additional styling.
  - **images/screenshot.png:** Placeholder for application screenshots or other images.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Python 3.7+** installed on your machine. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **pip** package manager installed. It typically comes bundled with Python.
- **Git** installed for cloning the repository. Download it from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- *(Optional)* **Docker** installed if you plan to containerize the application. Get it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Flask Bootstrap App on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine using Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask_bootstrap_app.git
cd flask_bootstrap_app
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with other projects.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment to ensure that all Python packages are installed locally within the project.

- **On macOS and Linux:**

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- **On Windows:**

  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### 4. Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the required Python packages using `pip`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*This command reads the `requirements.txt` file and installs all listed dependencies.*

### 5. (Optional) Verify the Installation

To ensure that everything is set up correctly, you can run the Flask application.

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your web browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) to see the application in action.

*Ensure that you have Python 3.7+ and Git installed on your machine before proceeding with the installation steps.*
